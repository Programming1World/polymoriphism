# polymoriphism
Your objective for this project is to implement an abstract parent Shape class and its polymorphic children Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Shape is a 2D character array which requires the use of dynamic memory allocation, and its children are their eponymous shapes held character-by-character within that 2D array. Additionally, each shape is represented by its perimeter populated by ASCII characters within the range [48, 126] in order, and character choice from this range wraps around back to 48 when 127 is reached. In order to successfully complete this project, you must understand the prerequisite material from the previous projects, and you must understand the concepts of 2D arrays, abstract classes, polymorphism, and basic shape manipulations.
